# Multiavatar Fork

[Multiavatar](https://multiavatar.com) is a multicultural avatar generator, created by Gie Katon.
Forked from [repository](https://github.com/multiavatar/multiavatar-python)

## More Information

The purpose of this fork is to play around with [Jinja2](https://palletsprojects.com/p/jinja/) templating,
hence the separation between logical process in python and SVG rendering through a Jinja template.
The style configuration has been moved to `config/style.json`.
